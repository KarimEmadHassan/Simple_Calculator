This project builds a basic calculator using a PIC18f4620 microcontroller.

Features:

- Two-digit calculations
- Supports basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division)
- User interface with a keypad for input and an LCD for displaying numbers and results
- Error checking to handle invalid user input

Required Drivers:

- General Purpose Input/Output (GPIO)
- Liquid Crystal Display (LCD)
- Keypad

Operation:

The user can enter single-digit or double-digit number, followed by an arithmetic operator (+, -, *, /), and then another single-digit or double-digit number. The calculator performs the chosen operation and displays the result. The program includes checks to identify and handle any errors during user input.
